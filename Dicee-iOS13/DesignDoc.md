#  //design for this app

/*this is a yahtzee app
 
 Yahtzee is a game where the player rolls five dice. They then select dice to keep and reroll the rest. They can reroll up to two times (for 3 total rolls).
 
 When the player chooses to stop or after the third roll the player must select something from the score card and assign the roll they have to that score card item. They will be assigned points based on how their roll matches the criteria of that score card item.
 
 They then start a new roll and repeat the process.
 
 This continues until the score card is filled. When the scorecard is filled, the game is over and the player is assigned a score.
 
 The player can then record their score and start a new game.
